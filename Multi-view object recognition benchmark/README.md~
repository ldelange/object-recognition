# Single-view object recognition

Measures object recognition peroformance based on single view object recognition. Object maps are constructed for each object containing several views. Tests are conducted by discretising the object maps, which increases the space (degrees) between views.

## Descriptors

The [vl_feat](http://www.vlfeat.org/) library for MATLAB is used for feature extraction

* Local binary patterns
* Histogram oriented gradients
* Hue, saturation, value
* Neural Networks (imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16.mat)
* Scale invariant feature transform

## Image datasets
